 <summary><h3> 👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a highschool student with a passion to learn everything I could. I went to college at Iowa State University where I majred in Software Enigineering with a minor in Chemistry. As a computer science TA at Iowa State University, I was asked contribute and design programming material, tests, and homework for new Python courses. It was super rewarding was teaching and mentoring students to go above and beyond.

<summary><h3> ⚾ My Sports Journey</h3></summary>
    I grew up playing a ton of sports. While in high school, I was a caddy that was lucky enough to see some really good golf and meet some really great people. I also got the chance to coach my younger brother's YMCA basketball team when I was a senior, we won the championship NBD. At ISU, I participated in hockey, basketball, curling, golf, and basketball intermurals. As someone who grew up a block away from an MLB stadium, I am incredibly fortunate and stoked to now be a Data Engineer on the Colorado Rockies!!
